# About

This is simple Task App called Cardume. It's intent is to provide an intuitive interface combined with secure and private task management tasks. 

Ideally, the backend is going to be self-hosted and enabling (_eventually_) the user base to securely store their notes/tasks in the cloud allowing their devices to share the information.
